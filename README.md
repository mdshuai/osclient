# osclient
OpenShift-Client (osclient)
As a user I want to connet openshift server by a graphical interface client not just a comand line tool.Especial on 
windows, the user more like use graphcial tools than command in cmd.The project is written by Qt, so that we can cross-compile the code to run on windows, linux and Mac os.
